I developed this project by taking a book system of train as a reference code and implementing the idea of alamgating the ticktes which leads to increase the availability of seats and implementing the idea last-buy which will help us people who are needed train tickets at the last moment in our website this will breakdown into three verticals of cases. the first case to person who is ready to cancel the ticket, person wants to travel on train with the same ticket but he can't, and finally he just entered the station the train just left and he can't able to get in to train, we take all the possible cases and solve using our website, where some people will face these type problems.They can go to our website and ballot their tickets.This is completely an innovative project.
